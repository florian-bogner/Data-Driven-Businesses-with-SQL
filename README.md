# Eniac & Magist: Is Magist a good fit for Eniac?

## About

In this project, we investigated whether Magist—a fictitious online retail platform—could open the door to Brazilian online retail for Eniac, an equally fictitious Spanish online marketplace for Apple products and accessories. In order to determine Magist's fit, we had to figure out whether Magist's marketplaces are a good place for expensive high-end tech products. Another thing to consider were shipping times: Are orders delivered fast enough?

## Method

We looked into the [Data](https://github.com/huschpuscheli/Magist_colab/blob/main/data/magist_dump.sql) to get a bigger picture of Magist's business characteristics are.

To get a basic understanding of the relation of the schema you can either look at the [PDF](https://github.com/huschpuscheli/Magist_colab/blob/main/data/magist_schema.pdf) or the [MySQL schema](https://github.com/huschpuscheli/Magist_colab/blob/main/data/magist_schema.mwb).

In the [Big picture script](https://github.com/huschpuscheli/Magist_colab/blob/main/scripts/Big%20picture.sql, we checked
1. how many orders were placed in the given time frame
2. how many orders are delivered
3. whether Magist has user growth
4. what Magist's product range ist
5. what the product categories are that are sold on Magist
6. whether all products offered were actually part of an order
7. what the price ranges of products are
8. what the price ranges of order payments are
to get a basic understanding of the Magist marketplace.
