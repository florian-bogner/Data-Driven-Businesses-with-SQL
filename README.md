## About

In this project, we investigated whether Magist —— a fictitious online retail platform —— could open the door to Brazilian online retail for Eniac, an equally fictitious Spanish online marketplace for Apple products and accessories. In order to determine Magist's fit, we had to figure out whether Magist's marketplaces are a good place for expensive high-end tech products. Another thing to consider were shipping times: Are orders delivered fast enough?
